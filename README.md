# LQR-Pitch-Control-for-Boeing-747
In this project, we have used MATLAB as well as Simulink modeling to design an autopilot that controls the pitch of an aircraft. We have designed a PID Controller and a Lead Controller for controlling the pitch of an airplane. ● We have used LQR to find the appropriate gain matrix. ● We have discretized the system and then have performed all the analysis for the same. ● We have worked on improving some of the common drawbacks of using pre-compensators in LQR, while also pointing out another drawback of this control technique, by using the Simulink model and during that, making our controller more robust (by testing it with the step-disturbance)
